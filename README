To keep the SABnzbd+ queue size smallish this script monitors a temporary holding directory (the sickbeard NZB blackhole) for NZB files.  When it finds such files it checks to be sure that the SABnzbd+ queue is smaller than a configured amount, and if so, moves the oldest NZB file into the SABnzbd+ blackhole.
